        <h1>1. Back End Servers</h1>
        <p>Servers house information.  Back end servers support front-end functions such as serving up pages to a user's browser. They may or
             may not interact directly with the front-end but more likely run code that determines what information is sent to the browser. 
        </p>
        <p>Three good resources for understanding servers are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dummies.com</li>
            <li>Lynda.com</li>
            <li>How Stuff Works.com</li>
        </ul>
        

       <p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/programming/networking/network-basics-clients-and-servers/">Dummies.com </a>
         breaks complicated concepts into smaller, easy to read chunks in a language that is easy to digest for the beginner audience.</p>
            
            <p><a href = "https://www.lynda.com/Windows-Server-training-tutorials/2802-0.html"> Lynda.com</a>
            is a tremendous resource for learning a variety of technical skills.  Lynda.com's' instructors are first rate and their learning platforms address a broad audience, which 
            includes videos, interactive lessons, and text-based manuals. The downside? The cost.</p>

            <p><a href = "http://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-server1.html">How Stuff Works</a> explains complicated concepts in simple language, and is a very good
            resource for the beginner coder.  The site, however, is cluttered with distracting advertisiing. </p>
              
             
            
            <h1>2. SQL versus noSQL Data Bases</h1>
            <p> Both SQL and nonSQL or Structured Query Language, store data; they also retrieve and update data.
                SQL is a relational data base that is well suited for constructing tables and charts where the numbers of columns and formats that, like a phone book, remain static throughout.
                It is an excellent organizational tool but inflexible in that increasing the number of columns or other
                values may require the entire data base to be edited.</p>
                <p>noSQL organizes data in a non-relational format.  It is fluid, document-oriented and distributed, and well suited to blogs that
                    contain articles, photos, social media data, and videos as they can be stored in a single document.  noSQL Data bases are able store large volumes of
                    data with little structure and is compatible with cloud computing.</p> 
                <ul>

                    <li> Targeted to the beginner to intermediate learner, the<a href = "https://www.upwork.com/hiring/data/sql-vs-nosql-databases-whats-the-difference/ "> Upwork</a> blog is both
                     comprehensive and easy to follow without being too technical.  It offers excellent examples and explains which data base is best suited to a particular project.</li>
                        <li><a href = "https://www.sitepoint.com/sql-vs-nosql-differences/">Sitepoint</a> explains the differences between SQL and noSQL to an intermediate audience.  Examples compliment the text and is
                        comprehensive and more technical than beginner blogs.</li>

                        <li><a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp">W3Schools</a> is a comprehensive resource laden with lessons, examples and do it yourself tutorials.</li>
                </ul>

                        <h1> 3. JavaScript Questions</h1>
                         <p>Code Academy, Code School and W3Schools are excellent go-to resources for learning JS:</li>
                        
                             <ul> 
                            <li>Code Academy is a step-by-step learning forum geared to beginners but is painfully slow as an ongoing resource. </li>
                            <li>Code School is a comprehensive forum but only basic lessons are free.</li>
                            <li>W3Schools is comprehensive, easy to follow and enhances the user experience with their “Try It Yourself” buttons and links.</li>
                            </ul>        
                               
                        
                                    <p>ES6 is short for EcmaScript6.  The following resources effectively explain how "promises" works in JavaScript.</p>
                                    <ul>

                            <p>Video Studio Code is the text editor that is launched from GitHub.</p>
